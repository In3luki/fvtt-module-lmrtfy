## Currently Supported Systems:
- pf2e
 
## Changes vs. original LMRTFY 

Restricted:
* Currently only assigned player characters can be selected

Removed:
* No support for rollable tables

Added:
* Proper PF2e rolls for most stuff
* Added lore skill support
* Added a "Pick one option" option, so the roll window will close after the player used one roll
* Added the possibility to enter a DC, which will be checked by the PF2e-system (a rule element for DC result modifiers, like Evasion, is already on the way there)
* Added the rank and current modifier to the roll description for the players

Incomplete:
* Translations are not up to date (so better use English only)

## Remarks

This currently is an on-purpose build, and there is no guarantee for future support, and I can't promise to fulfill any external wishes.
